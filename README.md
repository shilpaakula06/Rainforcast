Conclusion:
Evaludated data based on Logistic Regression and sequential Neural Networks. Best results were found with Neural networks with 100% accuracy on Train and Test data.

Data Clearning:

Removed Missing Data, Duplicates
Missing Data replaced with Mode value
Did Upsampling using sample technique
Used Label encoding to convert object to categorical varibales
Did stratification of data to normalized data
Did MinMax scaling to standadarize data
Train Test split was 80-20%
